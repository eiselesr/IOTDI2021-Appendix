Used ncat to capture POST requests. I needed to compare the format of the REST requests generated by Python vs the Pulsar function cli.

* `ncat -l localhost 8081`
* ```
  telnet localhost 8081 [ENTER]
  <paste content of cli-version.txt>
  ```

then 

* `ncat -l localhost 8081`
* ```
    python3 pulsar-rest.py 
  ```

Paste the output to `python-version.txt`. Comparing `cli-version.txt` and `python-version.txt` we were able to identify `user-agent` field in the header was incorrect.

`cli_packet.pcpng` was captured using `tshark` https://tshark.dev/capture/tshark/
* `apt install tshark`
* `tshark -w python_packet.pcapng -V -i lo tcp port 8080`
    * `-w` output file in pcapng format which can be opened with the wireshark gui. 
    * `-V` verbose
    * `-i lo` specify to use the local loopback interface. 
* `python3 pulsar-rest.py ` 
* `tshark -w cli_packet.pcapng -V -i lo tcp port 8080`
* `make reverse`

`hello.http` is 

This was simply to help understand how ncat and telnet interact. ncat returns `hello.http`.
```
ncat -l localhost 8081 < hello.http
telnet localhost 8081
```
